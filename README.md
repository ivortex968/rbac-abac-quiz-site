# RBAC vs ABAC Quiz Website

A clean, modern, and interactive web-based quiz application designed to test your knowledge of Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) concepts.

## Overview

This project is an educational quiz website that helps users learn and assess their understanding of two fundamental access control models used in information security:
- **RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)**: Access permissions assigned based on user roles
- **ABAC (Attribute-Based Access Control)**: Access decisions based on attributes of users, resources, and environment

## Features

‚ú® **20 Comprehensive Questions**: Covers key concepts, differences, and use cases of RBAC and ABAC

üìä **Progress Tracking**: Visual progress bar shows how far you've progressed through the quiz

‚úÖ **Instant Feedback**: Immediate feedback on each answer with correct answer explanations

üé® **Modern UI/UX**: Beautiful gradient design with smooth animations and responsive layout

üì± **Mobile Responsive**: Works seamlessly on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices

üèÜ **Score Summary**: Detailed results page with percentage score and performance feedback

- **80-99%**: Excellent! Strong understanding of access control models
- **60-79%**: Good job! Solid grasp of the basics
- **40-59%**: Not bad! Consider reviewing to improve understanding
- **0-39%**: Keep learning! Review RBAC and ABAC concepts

## Learning Outcomes

After completing this quiz, you will be able to:
- Distinguish between RBAC and ABAC access control models
- Understand when to use each model in different scenarios
- Identify key components of each access control approach
- Recognize the advantages and limitations of both models
- Apply access control principles to real-world security scenarios
